## Introduction
As I progress through the various challenges on HackerRank, this repository will serve as my personal record. Each problem will be documented with its difficulty level, max score, and my solution, helping me track my growth and keep learning Linux shell scripting.

The problems range from simple bash commands to more complex tasks involving recursion, file manipulation, arrays, and advanced tools.

## Problem Categories

### Bash (Basic)
- Problems that focus on basic bash scripting tasks, such as loops, conditionals, text manipulation, and file handling.

### Text Processing (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`)
- This section contains challenges that require advanced text processing techniques using commands like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`.

### Arrays and File Manipulation
- Problems that require working with arrays and manipulating files using bash commands.

### Recursive and Advanced Challenges
- Complex problems that involve recursion and fractal-based thinking in bash scripting.

## Solved Challenges

Below is the list of problems I have solved, organized by their difficulty levels and structured according to the directory hierarchy:

## Skills Required
To solve these problems, I need knowledge and understanding of the following concepts:
- Basic Bash scripting (loops, conditionals, variables)
- Text processing tools such as `grep`, `sed`, `awk`
- Array manipulation in Bash
- Working with file I/O operations in Bash
- Functions, recursion, and fractals in Bash


## Running Bash Scripts

To execute the Bash scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Ensure Bash is Installed
Bash is pre-installed on most Linux and macOS systems. To verify installation, run:

```bash
bash --version
```

For Windows, you can use:
- **Git Bash**
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**

### 2. Navigate to the Script Directory
Open your terminal and move to the directory where the script is located. Example:

```bash
cd path/to/Linux-Shell/Script_folder
```

### 3. Make the Script Executable
Before running a script, ensure it has executable permissions. Use the `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```

For example:
```bash
chmod +x echo.sh
```

### 4. Run the Script
Run the script using one of the following methods:

1. **Direct Execution**:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   ./echo.sh
   ```

2. **Using the Bash Command**:
   ```bash
   bash script_name.sh
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   bash echo.sh
   ```

### 5. Providing Input (If Required)
If a script requires input, you can:
- Provide it interactively when prompted.
- Pass it as command-line arguments, if supported by the script:
  ```bash
  bash script_name.sh input1 input2
  ```
- Provide input from a file by redirecting the file content to the script:
  ```bash
  bash script_name.sh < input_file.txt
  ```
  Alternatively, if the script is designed to accept input from a file, you can simply specify the file name directly:
  ```bash
  ./script_name.sh input_file.txt
  ```
  where `input_file.txt` contains the data you want to provide as input to the script.
